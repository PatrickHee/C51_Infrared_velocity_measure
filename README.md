This repository is a place for a freshman to store some simple codes......             :)


The 51-single-chip system folder contains the hardware descriptions of SST89E516RD single chip and other relative modules,and the C source file about how to design this system to finish the function of Infrared speed detecting.

You can use the software called "Keil C51" to construct a project and expand your idea and design based on the C source file.
